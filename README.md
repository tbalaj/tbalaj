👋 Hi, I’m @tbalaj

👀 I’m interested in software development, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity.
🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack development with a focus on JavaScript frameworks and exploring machine learning algorithms.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, and research in AI and machine learning.
📫 How to reach me: You can reach me via email at teodorabalaj@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/teodora-balaj-85941b186/.
😄 Pronouns: She/her
⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking the nearest trail—I've logged over 100 miles of hiking in the past year alone! I love photography as well and persue it as a freelance photographer in my spare time.
