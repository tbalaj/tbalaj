-👋 Hi, I’m @tbalaj

<br>-👀 I’m interested in software development, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.
<br>-🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack development with a focus on JavaScript frameworks and exploring machine learning algorithms.
<br>-💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, and research in AI and machine learning.
<br>-📫 How to reach me: You can reach me via email at teodorabalaj@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/teodora-balaj-85941b186/.

<br>-⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking the nearest trail—I've logged over 100 miles of hiking in the past year alone! I love photography as well and 
 persue it as a freelance photographer in my spare time.
